# Documentation for Terminal Screen Renderer

## Overview
This application simulates a terminal screen renderer that interprets and executes a sequence of binary commands to produce visual output in the terminal. The commands define screen setup, character placement, line drawing, text rendering, and other terminal screen manipulations.

The application leverages the Python `curses` module for terminal screen rendering and processes binary data streams to execute commands.

---

## Features
1. **Screen Setup**: Initialize screen dimensions and color mode.
2. **Draw Character**: Place a character at specified coordinates.
3. **Draw Line**: Draw a straight line between two coordinates using a specified character.
4. **Render Text**: Render strings starting at a specified position.
5. **Move Cursor**: Move the cursor without drawing.
6. **Draw at Cursor**: Draw a character at the current cursor position.
7. **Clear Screen**: Clear the entire screen.
8. **End Command**: Mark the end of the binary command stream.

## File Structure
- **`main()`**: Entry point for the application. It defines the binary stream and invokes the rendering process.
- **`render_terminal(screen, commands)`**: Processes commands and renders them to the terminal.
- Individual command handlers:
  - `setup_screen(data)`
  - `draw_char(screen, data)`
  - `draw_line(screen, data)`
  - `render_text(screen, data)`
  - `move_cursor(screen, data)`
  - `draw_at_cursor(screen, data)`
  - `clear_screen(screen)`

---

## How It Works
1. **Binary Stream Parsing**:
   The `parse_binary_stream(stream)` function reads and parses the binary command stream. Each command includes:
   - A command byte.
   - A length byte.
   - Associated data bytes.

2. **Command Execution**:
   Commands are executed sequentially by the `render_terminal` function. Each command is mapped to its corresponding handler.

3. **Terminal Rendering**:
   The `curses` library handles terminal interactions. Commands are interpreted and rendered in the terminal window.

## Running the Application
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- Terminal or shell that supports `curses` rendering.

### Steps
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `terminal_renderer.py`.
2. Run the script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python terminal_renderer.py
   ```
3. View the terminal screen output. Press any key to exit.

## Example Binary Stream
The following example demonstrates a binary stream that performs various rendering tasks:
```python
binary_stream = bytearray([
    COMMAND_SETUP, 3, 30, 20, 0x01,            # Set up a 30x20 screen
    COMMAND_DRAW_CHAR, 4, 5, 5, 0x02, ord('A'), # Draw 'A' at (5, 5)
    COMMAND_DRAW_LINE, 6, 10, 10, 20, 10, 0x02, ord('-'),  # Draw a horizontal line
    COMMAND_RENDER_TEXT, 6, 3, 3, 0x02, ord('H'), ord('i'), ord('!'), # Render "Hi!"
    COMMAND_MOVE_CURSOR, 2, 15, 5,             # Move cursor to (15, 5)
    COMMAND_DRAW_AT_CURSOR, 2, ord('*'), 0x02, # Draw '*' at cursor
    COMMAND_END, 0                             # End commands
])
```

## Code Explanation
### Core Components
1. **Command Identifiers**:
   - Constants (e.g., `COMMAND_SETUP`, `COMMAND_DRAW_CHAR`) define the binary codes for each command.

2. **Command Handlers**:
   - Each handler processes the corresponding command's data to perform actions on the screen.

3. **Binary Parsing**:
   - The `parse_binary_stream` function ensures data integrity and extracts commands and their parameters.

4. **Curses Wrapper**:
   - The `curses.wrapper` ensures proper initialization and cleanup of the terminal screen.

## Key Functions
### `parse_binary_stream(stream)`
Parses the binary command stream and yields commands with associated data.
- **Parameters**: `stream` (bytearray) - The input binary stream.
- **Returns**: Generator of `(command, data)` tuples.

### `render_terminal(screen, commands)`
Executes parsed commands and updates the terminal screen.
- **Parameters**:
  - `screen` (`curses` screen object) - Terminal screen object.
  - `commands` (iterator) - Parsed commands.

### Command Handlers
- `setup_screen(data)`: Configures screen dimensions and color mode.
- `draw_char(screen, data)`: Draws a character at specified coordinates.
- `draw_line(screen, data)`: Renders a straight line using Bresenham's algorithm.
- `render_text(screen, data)`: Displays a string starting at a given position.
- `move_cursor(screen, data)`: Moves the cursor to a specified position.
- `draw_at_cursor(screen, data)`: Draws a character at the current cursor location.
- `clear_screen(screen)`: Clears the screen.

## Troubleshooting
1. **Malformed Stream**:
   Ensure the binary stream is properly structured with valid command and length bytes.

2. **Terminal Compatibility**:
   Some terminals may not fully support `curses`. Test on a standard Linux terminal for best results.

## Conclusion
This application demonstrates how to interpret and render complex binary data streams in a terminal environment using Python. It is a versatile tool for visualizing screen-based command execution.
